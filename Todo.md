This is a Todo list of possible ideas I can use in the future of my company!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I will most likely not "sell" my software, but instead give it away for free as open source projects.
  - The reason I will want to do this is because it makes it very hard for me to put a back door in it (against my will?)
* I care about the customer (and consumers) privacy and I will do everything I can to keep it there.
  - Obviously that will be a challenge as not everyone agrees with my theology, so I will need the help of the community to check me to ensure that happens (NO, REALLY, I AM SERIOUS!!! CHECK ME CONSTANTLY!!!)!!!
* Figure out how UEFI works.
  - Can UEFI protect against hardware keylogging? I sure hope so, but if not, well, at least a user can sign the OS with his or her own key.
  - I may have to be a manufacturer that works like Rasberry Pi and Arduino with Open Source hardware to make sure everyone knows what they have purchased!
    - I like the sound of Open Source Hardware! I has a nice ring to it! Maybe I can include the OS on the hardware for the consumers, but make it easy for the consumer to pull it off so they can verify the integrity of the OS and check the GPG signature that comes with it!
* I will obviously have to be so transparent that a middle schooler should be able to understand it and duplicate the hardware and software with the right instructions (I started programming at least since 5, probably more like 8, but I never wrote down the age)!
* The idea of Open Source Hardware and Software (OSHS) will mean that someone could use "Nanobots" to synthesis the hardware and software on the spot!
  - This is a world changing idea (How will it affect the economy? It will probably change it greatly overtime if everyone actually learns something about how to read and write hardware and software, even if just at a basic level.)!
  - Power to the Polymath!

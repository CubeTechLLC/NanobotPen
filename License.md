# License

Normally I am a copyleft kind of guy, but this is a hardware project, so I am extremely picky about my copyright.<br>
As for this project, all ideas, schematics, code, designs, or anything related to the pen are ALL RIGHTS RESERVED!<br>
This includes ideas of what the pen can do, even though I do not have blueprints for it yet.<br><br>

The only exception so far is the actual os, IceCube, and I am explicitly copylefting that according to the license in that
project, because I want people to see how it works and be able to make there own versions of the os, without copying my
code or ideas, but to base it off of the idea from my code and ideas. The same goes for the pen, that alternatives can be
made, but any idea I write down here is my own work and cannot be touched. If I use someone else's idea and base it off of
their idea, I check the copyright first and then link to where I got the idea from, although I may more than likely only
use external references for pages like how to make integrated circuits, or how to make microcircuitry for nanobots so I can
learn how to make my own, but not to copy other's ideas. I expect the same. If I decide to release this to public domain,
then anybody can use these ideas. Really I am not going to sue for others making personal projects for my ideas if they are not
going to sell it, or attempt to steal the copyright. The main concern is just putting this in a public directory so others 
cannot steal my copyright as it will be proven that I created it and so I can continue to sell my own product without someone
else saying they created it.

So in other words I invented this idea and all other files in the project, unless I explicitly 
mention otherwise. You can create your own projects based off of this idea, but I invented the original idea.

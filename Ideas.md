# Ideas

### Packaging
Package Nanobots into cubes and have user press button to let it fall into a pile of ash, or turn into a vial of ink.

### Safety
As for safety, one can reason this pen will allow creation of weaponry, thereby making it unsafe for the public. 
They are right, it is unsafe, but so is printing off guns on a 3d printer. Source: http://www.wired.com/2014/05/3d-printed-guns/
That is an issue that bugs me, as I am working on a way to solve that problem, and sure laws can be put into place to limit what can be made and not made, but that just like everything else will have to be solved by the public if everyone is going to accept the pen as a new invention. Do the pros outway the cons, or should the opportunity cost be not inventing the pen.

### Pen
* The pen is mightier than the sword when it can be used for a variety of purposes including protection, notes, work, school, and 
so much more.
* One fun use is drawing a watch on your arm and having pattern recognition turn that drawing into a functioning watch.
* The pen will have a 2d mode and a 3d mode. The 2d mode is useful whether the user is making a watch or painting the portraits 
from the Harry Potter movies, or even taking a school year's worth of notes which only takes up one notebook page. This saves 
weight and ink for the student as the student is only using pattern recognition to write the notes.
* The 3d mode will be more useful for building objects that are needed such as that forgotten water filter for your camping 
trip, or prototyping, models, laptops, phones, and so many more items and can feature the full spectrum of colors of the real 
world whether it is in 2d or 3d.
* A planned, but possibly difficult feature is making the 3d pen levitate, so the user can draw in the middle of the air.
